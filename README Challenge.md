1. What is this repo all about?
     - This repo is a conglomeration of my publishe work while attending the Codefellows Cybersecurity course.

2. Why are you learning these skills?
     - I am striving towards the opportunity to provide for myself and my family. I want to have the funds capable of supporting my strive towards independance. I love video games and I hope to be able to help with protecting the games I love and improving the industry as a whole.

3. What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
     - I learned about languages that are used differently to code different sorts of scripts or coding lines, executables and others. I also learned about networking and troubleshooting routines. The ethics and thought process behind hacking, and many reasons why someone may launch a malicious attack.

4. What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
     -  really enjoyed any of the Ops Challenges that included the read command as it felt like a baseline video game, getting an idea behind things of the sort like that are something extremely interesting to me. It feels one step closer to understanding what happens behind the scenes in the industry.

5. How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
     - Having the ability to automate processes like documenting and reporting logs, for instance, is just a small example of how somebody's work process could be simplified or turned more efficient.

6. What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
     - Any script involving arrays and sorting through items individually that then provides a requested item.

7. What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
     - I would love to improve my ability to assess and fix problems within my script by myself. Of course, I will be getting help in order to get to that point. But, I am excited for the day that I can feel autonomous in my Ops Challenges.
